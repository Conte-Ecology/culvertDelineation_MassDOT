Culvert Delineation - MassDOT
=============================

This repository contains scripts and processes used to delineate watershed 
polygons from point locations on a stream network. Watersheds contributing flow 
to culvert and flow gage locations are delineated and catchment attributes are 
calculated for each location. The point delineation 
[project page](http://conte-ecology.github.io/culvertDelineation_MassDOT/) 
documents these efforts. The process utilizes the NHDHRDV2 hydrography 
described on the Spatial Hydro-Ecological Decision System (SHEDS) 
[project page](http://conte-ecology.github.io/shedsGisData/).
